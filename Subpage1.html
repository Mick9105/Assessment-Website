  <!-- This is one of the sub-pages of the website. It is focused on the various relelvant implications of the AS91903 standard, which explains the various key terms of the
  implications and how they relate to the development of a website. I also aligned the code itself so that it fits on my screen that I usually work with (so a 14 inch screen
approximately, so if the code looks strange as if it doesn't fit or have unusal spacing out of paragraphs, this is just to help me see all the text. Other than that, nothing
strange should be here.-->
  <h1> Relevant Implications </h1>
  <p> In a lot of the digital standards, one of the key requirements for passing the standards is addressing relevant implications. Relevant implications are, by definition,
    seeing something being represented as something else entirely. For example, a drawing of a red cross can be seen as the hospital, but can also be seen as the cross used
    in churches. We often draw conclusions of what something means or represents, and in terms of developing a website, you need to be careful about what you add onto a 
    website, so it does not be seen as something else entirely (potentially offensive). </p>
  <p> The standard gives a wide range of implications that are all relevant to the development of a website. Addressing all of these implications in your website will mean
    that the message you are trying to get across is clear and can’t be misinterpreted as something else entirely. Here are some examples of implications and how you can 
    address them. </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Social- means respecting issues within society that can affect the performance or usability of the website. This one is harder to find any serious impacts on websites, 
      so it may not be entirely relevant. </li>
    <li> Cultural- means that understanding how different cultures might view pieces of information differently (and maybe offensively). For example, using an important 
      Maori sign inappropriately would be a cultural implication. The website should account for this, but otherwise if there are no cultural additions, then it wouldn’t 
      be too relevant. 
    <li> Legal- means that it follows the legal rules with the product. For example, you can’t plagiarise anyone's work. In terms of a website, this means that you follow 
      the normal rules around creating something or copying someonelse's work, such as quoting or paraphrasing someone's words, or following copyright procedures. </li>
    <li> Ethical- means morally right things. In terms of a website, it must reassure the end user that all the normal protocols are followed, such as respecting privacy 
      and information is factually correct. </li>
    <li> Intellectual property- means property that was made by someone else and is “claimed” by them as their own creation. In website development, this would mean things
      such as copyright or plagiarism. </li>
    <li> Privacy- means that people’s privacy is protected and respected when they use the website. Are there risks of attacks on your website? Are your users safe when 
      clicking on different links on your website? Do you need user input to make the website as safe as possible for the end users (such as cookies)? </li>
    <li> Accessibility- means that it needs to be accessible to your end users. How does someone access your website? Can it be easily accessed? Is it heavily protected
      by various measures, such as paywalls? </li>
    <li> Usability- means that the website has a purpose; it is useful for the end users. Is your information actually useful? Can it be made more useful? Do you need 
      extra diagrams or examples to make it more useful? </li>
    <li> Functionality- means that the product functions as it should. Does it have any bugs that are not meant to happen? Does everything function properly? Do you need
      to add in more functions to make the website function better? </li>
    <li> Aesthetics- means the looks and designs of the website. If the design is poorly done, then the website will not look as appealing, and therefore very boring. 
      This is more important for games than websites, but it can help keep end users interested and focused on key information. </li>
    <li> Sustainability and future proofing- means that the product can be used in the future for long periods of time. Can the information written on the website become
      outdated? Can it be updated in the future to make it reliable? </li>
    <li> End-user requirements- means that the end product must cover all your end user requirements. As an example: it must have detailed examples of dinosaur extinction. 
      This is an important implication for websites. </li>
    <li> Healthy and Safety- means keeping the end users safe from danger. This does fall under some of the other implications, such as privacy and intellectual property. 
      So in terms of developing a website, the key thing is to ensure that the health and safety of end users using the website is respected, such as privacy. </li>
  </ul>
<p> This is important for passing the standard, because it sits in the achieved section of the achievement standard. If you don’t address this, you won’t pass the 
  standard. It also is a recurring criteria in multiple standards alongside AS91903, so addressing this here will also help you address this in other standards. </p>
