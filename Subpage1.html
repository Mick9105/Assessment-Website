  <!-- This is one of the subpages of the website, which is designed to explain the relevant implications of digital media outcomes. Relevant implications is a 
recurring requirement in digital technologies, which also involves the digital media outcome. This sub-page is designed to talk about what relevant implications are, 
and what the various examples in the standard mean and how they apply in terms of developing a website.-->

  <p> In a lot of the digital standards, one of the key requirements for passing the standards is addressing relevant implications. Relevant implications are, by 
    definition, seeing something being represented as something else entirely. For example, a drawing of a red cross can be seen as the hospital, but can also be seen 
    as the cross used in churches. We often draw conclusions of what something means or represents, and in terms of developing a website, you need to be careful about 
    what you add onto a website, so it does not be seen as something else entirely (potentially offensive). </p>
  <p> The standard gives a wide range of implications that are all relevant to the development of a website. Addressing all of these implications in your website will mean
    that the message you are trying to get across is clear and can’t be misinterpreted as something else entirely. Here are some examples of implications and how you can 
    address them. </p>
      <h3> <b> Social </b> </h3>
      <p> refers more to human society, and how your website can be interpreted to human society. It depends on the content of your website, and what 
      your information is about. Think about who your end users are going to be, and think “Is this appropriate to them?” </p>
      <h3> <b>Cultural </b> </h3>
      <p> means that understanding how different cultures might view pieces of information differently (and maybe offensively). For example, using an 
      important Maori sign inappropriately would be a cultural implication. The website should also be aware that they must be culturally inclusive, in other words: 
      Make the website accessible and appropriate for all cultures. The key thing is to make it accessible and appropriate for all cultures and races, not just one. </p>
      <h3> <b>Legal </b> </h3>
      <p> means that it follows the legal rules with the product. For example, you can’t plagiarise anyone's work. In terms of a website, this means that
      you follow the normal rules around creating something or copying someone else's work, such as quoting or paraphrasing someone's words, or following copyright 
        procedures. </p>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <h3> <b>Ethical </b> </h3>
      <p> means morally right things. Is it appropriate that the information and media assets are appropriate to your end users? Try to think about 
        who you want to view it, and then ask yourself “Is this appropriate?”. </p>
      <h3> <b>Intellectual property </b> </h3>
      <p> means property that was made by someone else and is “claimed” by them as their own creation. In website development, this would
      mean things such as copyright or plagiarism. It is lawfully unacceptable to be taking someone else’s property and using it as your own, without the owner's 
      permission to use it. It is easy to find an image and copy it to your website, but if you don’t take the necessary precautions of addressing copyright or 
        plagiarism, then you risk having your website being taken down from the internet. </p>
      <h3> <b>Privacy </b> </h3>
      <p> means that people’s privacy is protected and respected when they use the website. Are there risks of attacks on your website? Are your users 
      safe when clicking on different links on your website? Do you need user input to make the website as safe as possible for the end users (such as cookies)? A 
      well-protected website that is not prone to hacker attacks and keeps your privacy safe is a website that makes the end-user feel safer to explore your website. 
      Make sure to always respect people’s privacy, and make sure that any data that they input into the website will be protected. </p>
    <h3> <b>Accessibility </b> </h3>
      <p> means that it needs to be accessible to your end users. How does someone access your website? Can it be easily accessed? Is it heavily 
      protected by various measures, such as paywalls? It depends on what the context and purpose of your website is, but whether you want only a few people to access 
      your website, or you want the whole world to access your website will determine how accessible your website should be. </p>
    <h3> <b>Usability </b> </h3>
      <p> means that the website has a purpose; it is useful for the end users. Is your information actually useful? Can it be made more useful? Do 
      you need extra diagrams or examples to make it more useful? Following User experience principles is one way to help make your website useful to your end users. </p>
    <h3> <b>Functionality </b> </h3>
      <p> means that the product functions as it should. Does it have any bugs that are not meant to happen (a bug is an error in the code)? Does
      everything function properly? Do you need to add in more functions to make the website function better? This can also fall under Non-core functionality, where you
      might need to add in other functions from other sources to help make your website run better. Here is an example of a functionality issue:
      <br>
      <br>
    <img src="ExperimentalPhoto.jpg" title="Example of an image that isn't working">
      <br>
      <br>
        This image is the same as the one on the complex techniques website.
      <h3> <b>Aesthetics </b> </h3>
      <p> means the looks and designs of the website. If the design is poorly done, then the website will not look as appealing, and therefore very 
      boring. This is more important for games than websites, but it can help keep end users interested and focused on key information. You will still need to 
      consider various other factors, such as User Experience Principles and implications of ethical and social, but making your website aesthetically pleasing is 
        always expected by end users. </p>
      <h3> <b>Sustainability and future proofing </b> </h3>
      <p> means that the product can be used in the future for long periods of time. Can the information written on the 
      website become outdated? Can it be updated in the future to make it reliable? Think of it as making the website reliable to use, something that you would be 
      familiar with if you are doing in-depth research on a topic in class. If you can’t make your website sustainable, nor can it be updated, then it will not be 
        addressing this implication. </p>
      <h3> <b>End-user requirements </b> </h3>
      <p> means that the end product must cover all your end user requirements. End users means the people accessing your website 
      from the internet. If you focus your website on meeting your end-user requirements, then your website will suit its purpose as best as it can, which should 
        always be a priority in terms of website development. </p>
     <h3> <b>Healthy and Safety </b> </h3>
     <p> means keeping the end users safe from danger. Think about what you are putting onto your website, then think “Can this lead to 
      someone being harmed?” If so, do you have measures in place to stop end users from reading this information or accessing the information (such as a warning 
        message, or a prompt that warns them of opening the link)? </p>
<p> This is important for passing the standard, because it sits in the achieved section of the achievement standard. If you don’t address this, you won’t pass the 
  standard. It also is a recurring criteria in multiple standards alongside AS91903, so addressing this here will also help you address this in other standards. To
      actually pass this particular section, however, you should aim to address 2-3 relevant implications really well that applies to your website (as not all relevant implications
      will have to be addressed for your particular context). Aim for quality, not quantity. </p>
