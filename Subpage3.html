     <!-- This is the 3rd and final subpage, which talks about the other skills needed to use in the development of a digital media outcome. These cover the Achieved, Merit
and Excellence sections, but some can be difficult to understand at first. This page is to explain some of these complicated terminologies, and how this would work in 
the context of developing a website -->

    <p> Alongside the relevant implications and complex techniques, you are also required to do a number of other things to pass the standard (from the standard): </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <q>Applying appropriate tools and techniques to meet the purpose and end-user requirements </q> </li>
      <li> <q>Applying appropriate data integrity and testing procedures </q> </li>
      <li> <q>Applying user experience principles relevant to the purpose of the outcome </q> </li>
    </ul>
    <p> To get Merit, you need to do the above, but also use testing procedures and user experience principles to improve the quality of your website.
      <br> <br>
      To get Excellence, you need to do the requirements in the achieved and merit sections, but also <q>iterative improvement throughout the design, development and
      testing process to produce a high-quality outcome </q> 
      <br> <br>
      This can be quite complex, but the general idea is that if you want to get to Merit and Excellence, you need to not only apply the different techniques, but 
      show that it has improved the quality of the website, with constant improvement in the development of the website. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Data Integrity </b>- means that end users will know that the website contains factual and accurate information. This can be achieved by constant updating of
        data and still achieves the end user’s requirements or the product’s goal. </li>
      <li> <b>Testing Procedures </b>- means running tests on the product to ensure that the website and all the features of the website function as it should. An 
        example of this is testing that all the links in the website function as it should. </li>
      <li> <b>User Experience Principles </b>- means building the website around the user itself. Build the entire website around the end user, instead of focusing on 
        how you want the website to be built on. This includes the design of the entire website, as well as the functions of the website. As it is based on the user 
        experience, the website should be built so that the user experience is at the centre of focus. From <a href="https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-experience.html"
        target="_blank"> https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-experience.html </a> is a good photo of the different sections to the user experience principles: 
      <!-- Photo for User Experience Principles goes here --> </li>
      <img src="Experimental Photo2.jpg" title="Image from the link above, showing user experience principles in a hexagon template">
      <li> <b>Iterative improvement </b>- means improvement throughout the development of the website through consistent reviews and testing. So instead of just developing 
        the website and leaving it as the “original copy”, you want to get feedback from others and through testing and trialling to help improve the website. The feedback
        itself must be constructive, and there must be visible improvement of the website after seeing the results of the trialling, testing and feedback. A good way to do
        this is to trial one change of the code and write down what you expected to happen, what actually happened and what needs to be done moving forward. </li>
