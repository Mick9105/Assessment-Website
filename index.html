    <p> If you are a Year 13 student attempting to create a website inline with the AS91903 NCEA standard, or a student about to attempt the AS91903 standard who wants to 
    develop a website, then this website will help explain the standard.</p>

    relevant implications and complex techniques, with some explanations of other wording, for development of a website. It does not tell you how to develop a website, but
    how to make your website as good as possible in terms of the AS91903 (digital media) standard. </p>
