This is a project based website that I am developing as part of school. It is a website about explaining the New Zealand NCEA standard AS91903 in relation to the development of a website, but does not explain how to develop a website in general (in other words, explains how to develop the website in relation to the standard itself, but doesn't teach how to develop a regular website).
