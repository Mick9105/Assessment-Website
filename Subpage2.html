    <p> As a main feature of the standard, you are required to “Use complex techniques to develop a digital media outcome”. This means that you aren’t just developing a 
      random website. The website must incorporate a variety of complex techniques in order for you to pass the standard at the bare minimum. The complex techniques provided
      in the assessment standard are: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Non-core functionality </li>
      <li> Sophisticated Digital effects </li>
      <li> Industry standards/guidelines </li>
      <li> Responsive Design for use on multiple devices </li>
      <li> Integration of original media assets </li>
      <li> Dynamic data handling and interactivity </li>
      <li> Automation through scripts </li>
    </ul>
    <p> This section will explain these in detail: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Non-core functionality </b>-means other functionality options that are not used with the “core” functionality to make it function even better. This means
        that there is the main function(s) that is absolutely necessary to run the software (such as the raw code. If you are using HTML, then HTML is considered the 
        main function), and then there are the additional functions that help make the main function run better. In terms of a website, this would mean functions that 
        are not necessary to make the website function as it should, but help make it function better. This can include external functions from other softwares or 
        codes. As an example, you can use Github to help make your website run on the internet, but it isn’t 100% necessary for the function of the website. </li>
      <li> <b>Sophisticated digital effects </b>-means using sophisticated digital effects on your website to make it easier to use and nicer to look at. An example 
        is a special navigation heading where it sticks to the top of the viewpoint, and another example is a drop-shadow, when you want to view the list of options on
        a navigation tab. This must be on a “sophisticated” level, or high levelled digital effects. So it can’t be a simple digital effect like adding a different 
        colour, instead it has to be something more advanced than adding colour. This is achievable through the usage of CSS (if you are using HTML as well), but with 
        other coding languages (such as Java or Python), you might need to do some research into how to improve the aesthetics (the design) of the website. </li>
      <li> <b>Applying industry standards or guidelines </b>-means not just building the website based on how it looks, but actually following particular guidelines or
        conventions that professional websites follow. For example, if there is a particular design layout that all websites follow, this would be the layout that this
        website would have to follow. A typical design looks something like this: <br>
        <!-- Make your own google drawing and attach it here as a regular image. Use some of the designs that you were using as examples. -->
        <img src="Experimental Photo.jpg" title="Example design of a website design">
        <br>
        Of course, not all guidelines or standards may fit your website, so make sure you pick the ones that are most appropriate for your particular design, and find
        some way to compromise the other guidelines (for example, a guideline is to have the navigation tab on the top, but some websites like to run it on the side).
      </li>
      <li> <b>Responsive design for use on multiple devices </b>-means the design of the website must be capable of working on any device, such as a phone or an ipad. 
        Responsive means that it can respond to a different design if the device does not fit the requirements for the default design. A good example of this would be 
        that an end-user might access your website through their phones, and if your website isn’t flexible enough to fit the screen of a phone, then the product will 
        look really wonky to the view of an end user. The “usual” requirement for a phone is typically around 600px (px = pixels), so can your design fit this 
        requirement? If not, what can you do to modify the layout so it looks appealing on a phone? </li>
      <li> <b>Integration of original media assets </b>- means utilising original media assets to make your website more valuable. Media assets are pictures, diagrams,
        videos, etc, which can be integrated into a website. For example, you can integrate a youtube video onto your website, which can make your website more 
        interactive. However, the standard asks for “original media assets”, meaning that you need to integrate media assets that you have made yourself. You might need
        to do some research of your own to find out whether the code you use can achieve this, but it is definitely possible through HTML. </li>
      <li> <b> Dynamic data handling and interactivity </b>- means that data in the website is able to adapt and change based on the user input. For example, clicking
        on a video might give you suggestions on other videos that are relevant to what you are watching. The data must also be interactable for it to suit these 
        requirements as well. For some websites, this might not be easy to utilise, especially if your website doesn’t require data input. If your website does use 
        interactive data (for example, data collected on the end user’s preferences), make sure that it is used for the right reasons (such as providing suggestions 
        on other things on the website the end user might like), and is flexible enough to use (meaning that it can respond to numerous options; not fixed data). </li>
      <li> <b>Automation through scripts </b>-means utilising automation in the coding to make life easier for those using the website. Automation means that the 
        system can run on its own without the need for someone to manually change something. For example, machines in agriculture harvest the crops when it is ready 
        so that we don’t need people to collect the crops. Automation in coding will involve functions of the website working on their own without the need of a 
        person to actively turn something on/off. An example of automation through scripts would be adjusting the layout of the website to suit a different screen 
        size for the end user. </li>
