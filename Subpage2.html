    <h1> Complex Techniques </h1>
    <p> As a main feature of the standard, you are required to “Use complex techniques to develop a digital media outcome”. This means that you aren’t just developing a 
      random website. The website must incorporate a variety of complex techniques in order for you to pass the standard at the bare minimum. The complex techniques provided
      in the assessment standard are: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Non-core functionality </li>
      <li> Sophisticated Digital effects </li>
      <li> Industry standards/guidelines </li>
      <li> Responsive Design for use on multiple devices </li>
      <li> Integration of original media assets </li>
      <li> Dynamic data handling and interactivity </li>
      <li> Automation through scripts </li>
    </ul>
    <p> This section will explain these in detail: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Non-core functionality </b>-means other functionality options that are not used with the “core” functionality to make it function even better. This means that 
      there is the main function(s) that is absolutely necessary to run the software, and then there are the additional functions that help make the main function 
      run better. In terms of a website, this would mean functions that are not necessary to make the website function as it should, but help make it function better. 
      This can include external functions from other softwares or codes. </li>
      <li> <b>Sophisticated digital effects </b>-means using sophisticated digital effects on your website to make it easier to use and nicer to look at. An example is a 
        special navigation heading where it sticks to the top of the viewpoint, and another example is a drop-shadow, when you want to view the list of options on a 
        navigation tab. This must be on a “sophisticated” level, or high levelled digital effects. So it can’t be a simple digital effect like adding a different colour. 
        This appears to be achievable through CSS. </li>
      <li> <b>Applying industry standards or guidelines </b>-means not just building the website based on how it looks, but actually following particular guidelines or 
        conventions that professional websites follow. For example, if there is a particular design layout that all websites follow, this would be the layout that my 
        website would have to follow. This would be best covered in the design section. </li>
      <li> <b>Responsive design for use on multiple devices </b>-means the design of the website must be capable of working on any device, such as a phone or an ipad. 
        Responsive means that it can respond to a different design if the device does not fit the requirements for the default design. This is achievable through HTML 
        and CSS. </li>
      <li> <b>Integration of original media assets </b>- means utilising original media assets to make your website more valuable. This can be videos, important pieces of code,
        diagrams, logos, etc. The code of your website can be considered a digital asset, but media assets are the focus. </li>
      <li> <b>Dynamic data handling and interactivity </b>-means that data in the website is able to adapt and change based on the user input. For example, clicking on a video 
        might give you suggestions on other videos that are relevant to what you are watching. The data must also be interactable for it to suit these requirements as 
        well. </li>
      <li> <b>Automation through scripts </b>-means utilising automation in the coding to make life easier for those using the website. Automation means that the system can 
        run on its own without the need for someone to manually change something. For example, machines in agriculture harvest the crops when it is ready so that we 
        don’t need people (often slaves) to collect the crops instead. Automation in coding will involve functions of the website working on their own without the 
        need of a person to actively turn something on/off. </li>
    </ul>
